% Dark adaptation is the process by which our eyes adjust to lower light
% conditions after being exposed to brighter light. In this processes below
% thigs is happening to our eye.
% 
% 1)The pupils dilate to allow more light to enter the eye.
% 2)The photoreceptor cells in the retina, particularly the rod cells,
% become more sensitive to light. 
% 3)Rod cells are responsible for detecting dim light and are concentrated
% in the peripheral retina.
% 4)The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the eye regenerates the
% photopigment molecules in the rod cells that were bleached by the bright
% light.

% (a) When transform the image using according to 洧녮(洧논, 洧녽) = 洧녭(洧논, 洧녽) +
% 洧녫 and to ensure that 洧녮 values are within the range of [0, 255],it need
% to shift the pixel values of the image by a value 洧녫. This will shift the
% entire histogram to the right by the value 洧녫.
% 
% (b) When transform the image using the equation 洧녮(洧논, 洧녽) = 洧녭(洧논, 洧녽) 칑
% 洧녫 and in order to 洧녮 values to stay the within range of [0, 255], it
% need to do scaling the pixel values of the image by a constant value 洧녫.
% histogram h洧녮 will be stretched or compressed depend on the value of 洧녫.
% If 洧녫 is greater than 1, the histogram will be compressed, and if 洧녫 is
% less than 1, the histogram will be stretched.
% 
% (c) When  rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise, the histogram h洧녭
% remains unchanged. The reason for this is that rotation only changes the
% spatial arrangement of pixels, not their pixel values. The distribution
% of pixel values in the original image is preserved in the rotated image,
% so the histogram remains the same and it is not effecting the intensity
% of the image.
